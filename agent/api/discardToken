/**
 * A service provider node can decide to persist a service consumers token to avoid asking the master node to validate the token
 * every time the same consumer sends it a request. However, the service provider should be notified by the master
 * node in case the token was renewed or if the associated node was removed. Master nodes will invoke the current API
 * to send this notification to their subscribed service providers.
